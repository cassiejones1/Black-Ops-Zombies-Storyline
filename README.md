# Black-Ops-Zombies-Storyline
This will be the first half of the Zombies Storyline, to better help people who are struggling to make sense of how it started. 

This is the first half or the beginning of Treyarch's Zombie's storyline. This tells how things started and progressed through the first couple of games 
and how the apacalypse started. Because Alot of people who are new to the series don't fully know where to start with it. So we made it to help them. We also added the reference video to make sure we didn't miss anything. 
We used HTML and CSS to make this website.
